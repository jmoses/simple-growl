# SimpleGrowl

SimpleGrowl is a simple (duh) wrapper around RubyGrowl.  I _always_ for get the Growl syntax, and just want the pretty notifications.  So I use this.

Example:

 require 'rubygems'
 require 'ruby-growl'
 require 'simplegrowl'
 
 SimpleGrowl.set_password('password') ## If there's a password.  SG communicates over TCP to the local host
 SimpleGrowl.notify("That's it!")
